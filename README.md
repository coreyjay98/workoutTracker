## Project Description

For this project my main task was to utilise Mongoose with mongoDB and create routes and a database for this workout tracker app. The user has the ability to go onto the app and save a workout that they have completed, they can add exercises to an existing workout aswell as creating new workouts. The app also has the functionality of showing the user the stats of their recent workouts over a 7 day period, tallying the duration and amount of weight lifted amongst other things.

### Installation

As this app is ran through node, if you wanted to install it from GitHub you would need to install the required packages with NPM Install and you should be able to host the application through your local host on port 8080 (Change Port variable if you want to), if you wanted to host on Heroku ensure you use the 'dbURL' variable to connect to the hosted database with your own link

Alternatively I have hosted this app through Heroku and so instead of hosting it yourself, you can view the app I have created through this link here !

### Usage

Use of this application is simple as once you open the page on the Heroku site above you can input exercises and check the stats page to get the rundown of the workout stats

### Technologies Used
